## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}

library(plotly)
plot_ly(x= mtcars$mpg,
        y= mtcars$disp,
        data= mtcars,
        mode="markers")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
dat<- MASS::kde2d(x= iris$Sepal.Length, 
                y= iris$Sepal.Width, 
                h= iris$Petal.Length, 
                n= 50)

plot_ly(x = dat[['x']],
        y = dat[['y']],
        z = dat[['z']],
        type="surface",
        colorscale="Greens")
```
